# [InfiniTimeNext](https://github.com/stephen-polgar/InfiniTimeNext)

This repository is a fork of the [InfiniTime firmware](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime) for the PineTime smartwatch.
It was optimized for my daily use. Since it seems stable and useful, I decided to publish it for further development. 
## New main functions
- The stopwatch can run in the background
- Multiple saved alarm times with advanced settings
- Several saved timers can run at the same time
- Steps are shown in meters also
### Removed apps
 - Chimes 
 - All games
 - Metronome
 - WatchFace: InfiniTime, PineTime
### [Changes](doc/code/Apps.md)
Now most system and user application constructors are empty and are used to create new `Screen` based objects with different arguments.
Constructors do not load the screen. The watch screen are filled and cleaned by the `Screen::Load()` and `Screen::UnLoad()` methods.
The `utility/StaticStack.h` are replaced with `utility/ScreenStack.h` which can store `Screen objects` with different arguments.
And lots of small changes and optimizations.
### Installations
Use [InfiniSimNext](https://github.com/stephen-polgar/InfiniSimNext) to run in the simulator or install [firmware](https://github.com/stephen-polgar/InfiniTimeNext/releases) on [PineTime smartwatch](https://pine64.org/devices/pinetime/).

***Note**: We removed mentions to NRFConnect as this app is closed source and recent versions do not work anymore with InfiniTime (the last version known to work is 4.24.3). If you used NRFConnect in the past, we recommend you switch to [Gadgetbridge](https://gadgetbridge.org/).*

## Credits

I’m not working alone on this project. First, many people create pull requests for this project. Then, there is the whole #pinetime community: a lot of people all around the world who are hacking, searching, experimenting and programming the Pinetime. We exchange our ideas, experiments and code in the chat rooms and forums.

Here are some people I would like to highlight:

- [Atc1441](https://github.com/atc1441/): He works on an Arduino based firmware for the Pinetime and many other smartwatches based on similar hardware. He was of great help when I was implementing support for the BMA421 motion sensor and I²C driver.
- [Koen](https://github.com/bosmoment): He’s working on a firmware based on RiotOS. He integrated similar libs as me: NimBLE, LittleVGL,… His help was invaluable too!
- [Lup Yuen Lee](https://github.com/lupyuen): He is everywhere: he works on a Rust firmware, builds a MCUBoot based bootloader for the Pinetime, designs a Flutter based companion app for smartphones and writes a lot of articles about the Pinetime!
